== Basic Service written in Go

This is a minimal web service as a container.

The container image from the self-building Dockerfile will listen on the host:port defined by the environment variable `LISTEN_ADDR`, by default `:8080` which is all interfaces on port 8080

The greeting provided by the app can be customized with the `CUSTOM_GREETING` environment from the default of `Hello`

Greetings are served using HTTP to all sub-urls on the listen address
