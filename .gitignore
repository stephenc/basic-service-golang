# go.work files should generally not be checked into VCS, as their purpose is to develop multiple modules at
# the same time, and each module tends to have its own VCS repository. However, there are certain scenarios
# where it can make sense to check in go.work files, such as a monorepo holding multiple modules which
# depend on each other.
